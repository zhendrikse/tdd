> To me, legacy code is simply code without tests &#8212; [Michael Feathers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44919.Working_Effectively_with_Legacy_Code)

### Or even better...

> Legacy Code is valuable code you’re afraid to change &#8212; [Nicolas Carlo](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/what-is-legacy-code-is-it-code-without-tests/)

### 😱 But we need to modify it 😱 


![Question](./images/hiclipart.com.png)

---

### [The naive](https://github.com/nicoespeon/talk-how-to-change-untested-code): Edit and Pray 🙏

1. Edit the code
2. Test manually
3. Pray you didn't brake anything

&nbsp;
Drawbacks: very risky &amp; stressful
<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### [The ideal](https://github.com/nicoespeon/talk-how-to-change-untested-code): Write the damn tests ✅

1. Reverse engineer the specs from the code
2. Write automated tests
3. Refactor the code
4. Add your feature

&nbsp;
Drawbacks: very costly and sl-o-o-o-w...

### [The pragmatic](https://github.com/nicoespeon/talk-how-to-change-untested-code): Approval tests 💁

1. 📸 Generate an output you can snapshot
2. ✅ Use test coverage to find all input combinations
3. 👽 Use mutations to verify your snapshots

---

### [Approval tests](https://approvaltests.com/)

Also known as

- Characterization Tests
- Golden Master
- Snapshot Tests
- Locking Tests
- Regression Tests
---

### What we are going to test

```python
class Calculator():
  @staticmethod
  def addNumbers(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y
```

---

### How we verify

```python
import unittest
from approvaltests.approvals import verify
from calculator import Calculator

class CalculatorTest(unittest.TestCase):

  def test_main(self):
    # ARRANGE
    x: int = 1
    y: int = 2;
    # ACT
    result = Calculator.addNumbers(x, y)
    # APPROVE
    verify(result)
```

---

### Even with combinatorial tests 🤩

```python
...
from approvaltests.combination_approvals import verify_all_combinations

class CalculatorTest(unittest.TestCase):

  def test_add_combinatorial(self):
    verify_all_combinations( Calculator.addNumbers, [[1,2], [4,3]])
```

---

### Approval testing [use cases](file://solon.prd/files/P/Global/Users/C65923/UserData/Downloads/raid_informaatika_2021.pdf)

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
  Code without tests that needs to be changed
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
  APIs that return JSON or XML
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
  Complex return objects
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
  Strings longer than one line

---

### [You should NOT keep these tests](https://github.com/nicoespeon/talk-how-to-change-untested-code)

Problems:

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
  Existing behavior is captured, bugs included
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
  Tests will fail whenever behavior changes. Noisy!
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
  People will get used to just update them
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  You can't read them to understand what the code does
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
  Delete them or have a plan to replace them with unit tests.
